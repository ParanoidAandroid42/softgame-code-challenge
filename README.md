# Simple Code Challenge

This project is a task solution for Softgames Company.

## Tasks

### 1. CARDS (Stage name = CardStackStage)
- **Objective**:  Create 144 sprites (NO graphic objects) that are stacked on top of each other like cards in a deck (so that the object on top covers the one below but not completely). Every second 1 object moves from the top of the stack to the other stack - the animation of the movement should be 2 seconds long. At the end of the whole process you should have a reversed stack.

### 2. TEXT (Stage name = RandomRichTextStage)
- **Objective**: Create a tool that allows mixing text and images in a simple way (for example, displaying text with emoticons or prices with money symbols). It should display a random text with images in a random configuration and a random font size every 2 seconds.
 
### 3. TEXT (Stage name = FireParticleStage)
- **Objective**: Make a demo showing a great fire effect. Please keep the number of images small (max 10 sprites on the screen at the same time). Feel free to use existing libraries as you would use them in a real project.

### Technical requirements:
- Write your code in TypeScript and use pixi.js for rendering.
- Display the fps in the top left corner and run the application in full screen.
- Render responsively for both mobile and desktop devices.
